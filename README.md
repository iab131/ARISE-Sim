## 💡 Why FLL Simulator?

We built this simulator as a team of two students to make robotics more **accessible**, **engaging**, and **fun** — especially for younger students who don’t have access to physical kits. Inspired by our experience in **FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)**, we wanted to give back to the community and help spark curiosity in STEM through a hands-on, interactive learning platform.
