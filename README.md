## 💡 Why FLL Simulator?

We built this simulator as a team of two students to make robotics more **accessible**, **engaging**, and **fun** — especially for younger students who don’t have access to physical kits. Inspired by our experience in **FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)**, we wanted to give back to the community and help spark curiosity in STEM through a hands-on, interactive learning platform.

## 🔧 Built With

- **Unity (C#)** — Game engine for 3D simulation and AR support
- **Blender** — Custom modeling and part design
- **Vuforia / AR Foundation** — Augmented Reality integration
- **Scratch-style logic system** — Custom block-based visual programming

---

## 🎓 Ideal For

- Students exploring robotics for the first time
- Educators teaching STEM and FLL concepts
- Hackathon builders, game developers, and creators who love simulation
